1.1c
Performance measure: winning, following the rules of the game
Environment: chessboard
Actuators: next move
Sensors: move input (way of giving the machine update to the board state)

properties of the task environment:
- fully observable: whole board is visible at any time
- deterministic: only agents can affect the position reached before
- sequential: every move has future consequences
- semi-dynamic: chess (static game) played with a clock (impact of time passing)
- discrete: game divisible into small parts (moves)
- multi-agent: two players competing over one goal

1.1d
virtual assistant
P: answer to a question, carried out task
E: human
A: speach module, access to phone applications
S: voice recognition

Environment properties:
- partially observable
- single-agent
- nondeterministic
- episodic or sequential (virtual assistant can learn from previous command or not)
- static
- discrete

1.1e
simple reflex agent follows a set of rules not really knowing what it is doing
model-bassed reflex agent follows set of rules as well but, additionally, keeps track of the state of the world around it
goal-bassed agent also keeps track of its environment but is focuses on completing its goal
utility-based agent focuses on maximizing its inner "score" that keeps strack of task's quality
