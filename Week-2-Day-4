Supervised learning requires labeled data to train the model. Then, the machine is able to work on a new case based on experience built from previous examples.
Unsupervised learning means there is no labels. Computer figures out everything by itself and creates its model that way.

Inference is the process where computer creates new symbolic connections by itself through propositional logic.
Expert system is a rule based system that imitates a human expert based on their knowledge and applied logic.

ANNs are somewhat similar to biological ones but they differ heavily as well. For example, Neural networks are less populated and can produce every value from 0 to 1
instead of biological 1 or 0.

1f
ANN uses connectionist aproach. It tries to mimic human brain and the way it works.

I would consider using symbolic aproach in places where people might be rejected so that they could at least know what was the key factor instead of
"the machine spit out NO".
